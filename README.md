In addition to my role at Northeast, I also serve as a beta tester for RGB Productions. 
My responsibilities include conducting thorough testing for the ____ and Android (aka Quest2) versions of SoTD to ensure optimal performance and user experience.


## Interests
In my free time, I enjoy chilling and relaxing. 
I'm also interested in D&D fantasy worlds and tech-related topics.
I'm always looking to learn more and grow in my field.
